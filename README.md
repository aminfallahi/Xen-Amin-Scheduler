# Xen-Amin-Scheduler
A new scheduler for Xen Hypervisor!
This scheduler has been developed as the final project and thesis of my undergraduate studies at Iran University of Science and Technology. The scheduler has been optimized to improve I/O latency in scheduled I/O bound tasks by 900%, being evaluated with a couple of benchmark tools.
This mainly belongs to Xen Project and a few fixes in event channel and credit scheduler have been done by me.
